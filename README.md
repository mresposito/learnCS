Learn CS
=====================================

This is a collection of some data structures lectures that I was putting up for a small project. I ended up not having time for it, but I still wanted to share some of the writing that I have done. If you are interested, please feel free to use it however you want.

## Usage

You can view the various lectures by simply opening the PDF of a given class. Otherwise, you can compile them again with `LaTeX` in case you want to add some stuff to it. The folder `latexPackages` contains the packages you need to run in the class. 

## Requirements

You need to have `LaTeX` installed in order to compile the classes.
