I will go over this

packages
-----
for now I am using only 
https://code.google.com/p/minted/ follow the link to install all the dipendencies. 
You can find the packets that I am using inside the folder latexPacket. You can install the packets in you machine by copying any *.cls and *.sty in the folder ~/Library/texmf/tex. If it still doesnt recognize the packets, try any other folder in your latex path. You can see the latex path by calling the command:
  kpsepath tex | tr : '\n'
